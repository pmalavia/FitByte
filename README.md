# FitByte
FitByte is a health and fitness app developed for Android users. It is a tool to help users lose, gain, or maintain their weight by tracking calories.  A new user begins with creating a profile where they enter in weight, age, height, and goals.  Once the user has completed their profile, FitByte will determine the userâ€™s daily calorie goal.  The user can then track their calorie intake by logging their meals, and track the calories they've burned by logging their exercises.  Through daily logging and tracking, FitByte helps users reach their health and weight goals.
